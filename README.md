# Flood-Severity-Index-Using-PCA-and-AHP
This project builds a Flood Severity Index using AHP and PCA with data from the 2018 and 2019 Kerala floods. The workflow includes data preprocessing, computing indicator weights using AHP and PCA, and using Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict severity and validate the index.
